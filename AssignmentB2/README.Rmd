# AssignmentB2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AssignmentB2 is to showcase a function I created in STAT545B. The function I created is called, `Data_overview`. This function will provide basic summary statistics of a given numerical variable y (Max-Min, Mean, and Standard Deviation), grouped by a variable x...

## Installation

AssignmentB2 is not yet on CRAN, but you can download it form this repository using the following R command: 

``` r
devtools::install.github("stat545ubc-2021/Assignments-Kaialain")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. The following example will showcase the Data_overview function using the cars dataset. Using the Data_overview function, I have retrieved the mean and standard deviation of distance travelled, grouped by the speed of the car.

```{r example}
library(AssignmentB2)

Data_overview(cars, speed, dist)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
