# STAT-545B-Assignment-Repository


**Welcome!**
---
This repository will contain the projects I will be working on throughout the course *STAT545B*. At the time of the making of this `README.md` file, this repository contains only one file, which is the `.rmd` file containing the code I created for my Assignment B1. In the near future, however, I suspect that this repository will be supplemented with additional assignments. 


**How to interact with the files**

Follow the steps below to open the Markdown file on RStudio:
* Click the green ↓Code button and copy the GitHub Repository URL
* Open RStudio, and navigate File → New Project → Version Control → Git

* Click on Create Project Now you should have the Markdown file opened on Rstudio. 


**Assignments**

1. Assignment B1
- In this Assignment, we familiarized ourselves with functions. Using `function()`, we created our own function to aid in our future analyses. To ensure that the function we created is also doing the thing we intended it to do, we also used the `test_that()` function to conduct formal tests.
