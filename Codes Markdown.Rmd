## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Packages
For this Assignment, the following packages will be used:
```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
```

#' @title Group and Count
#'
#' @description Using this function, you will be able to group your data by a specified variable (x), and count the number of items contained in another variable (y). Note that this function will work best with categorical variables for x and y, 
#'
#' @params data The data that you will be using for this function.
#' @params x The variable in which you will be grouping the data by.
#' @params y The additional variable in which  be grouping the data by.
#'
#' @return This function will return the number of items contained in the grouping variable (x), and for each category of (y).
#' 
#' @examples 
#' group_and_count(mtcars, cyl, gear)
#' group_and_count(ToothGrowth, supp, dose)
#'

```{r penguins}
group_and_count <- function(data, x, y) {
  data %>%
    group_by({{ x }}) %>%
    count({{ y }})
}

head(penguins)


group_and_count(penguins, species, year)


penguins %>%
  mutate(
    mean_of_X = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max_Minus_Min = (max({{ y }}) - min({{ y }})))
```


#Testing the Function

```{r testing}

# Dear TA, The following is another function that I was trying to create, but it does not work. I couldn't quite figure out why the error is happening. I worked hard on it though, and I didn't want to just remove it, so I decided to keep it in my assignment.

#' @title Group & Summarize
#'
#' @description Using this function, you will be able to group your data by a specified variable (x), and create four columns indicating:
#' Max_Minus_Min
#' Mean
#' Stdev
#' IQR
#'
#' @params data The data that you will be using for this function.
#' @params x The variable in which you will be grouping the data by.
#' @params y The numerical variable of interest. This variable MUST be a numerical variable for this function to work.
#' @return This function will return descriptive characteristics of the numerical variable (y), where the range (max - min), mean, standard deviation, and interquartile range will be calculated.
#'
#' 
#' @examples
#' Data_overview(penguins, island, flipper_length_mm)
#' Data_overview(iris, Species, Sepal.Length)

```{r penguins}
Data_overview <- function(data, x, y, na.rm = TRUE) {
   if(!is.numeric({{ y }})) {
      stop('Oops! You must enter a numerical variable for your second variable for this function to work')
   }
data %>%
  group_by({{ x }}) %>%
  summarise(Max_Minus_Min = (max({{ y }}) - min({{ y }})),
            Mean = mean({{ y }}),
            Stdev = sd({{ y }}),
            IQR = IQR({{ y }}))
}

Data_overview(penguins, species, island)
```
